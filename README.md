# Company-Task-Management-System
A company management web application designed to organize and track employee tasks. The admin (general manager or team manager) assigns tasks to specific employees, and each employee can only view tasks related to them. Employees can update task status and also create personal tasks. The system includes separate dashboards for admins and employees.
